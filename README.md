WKS Platform is an open-source Case Management and Process Automation solution that leverages a powerful stack of technologies, including Camunda, MongoDB, Keycloak, Traefik, MinIO, OPA (Open Policy Agent), Form.io, Spring Boot, and React. It provides a comprehensive framework for managing and automating business processes, enabling organizations to streamline their operations, enhance efficiency, and improve decision-making.

WKS Platform is designed as a multi-tenant solution, allowing multiple organizations or departments to use the platform while ensuring data isolation and separation. It provides a secure and customizable environment for each tenant, enabling them to manage their cases, automate processes, and make data-driven decisions within their own dedicated space.

## Features

- **Case Management**: WKS Platform offers a robust case management system that allows users to track and manage cases throughout their lifecycle. It provides features such as case creation, assignment, status tracking, activity logging, and case resolution.

- **Process Automation**: With Camunda at its core, WKS Platform enables the automation of complex business processes. Users can design, model, and execute workflows, define process steps and decision points, and monitor process instances in real-time.

- **Data Persistence**: Leveraging MongoDB, WKS Platform ensures reliable and scalable data storage for case-related information. This facilitates efficient retrieval and analysis of data to gain insights and support decision-making.

- **Identity and Access Management**: Integration with Keycloak offers robust identity and access management capabilities, including user authentication, authorization, and role-based access control. This ensures secure access to the platform and its features, protecting sensitive information.

- **Policy Enforcement**: WKS Platform integrates with OPA (Open Policy Agent) to enforce fine-grained policies across the system. Policies can be defined to control access, validate data, enforce business rules, and ensure compliance with organizational regulations.

- **Traefik Integration**: WKS Platform seamlessly integrates with Traefik, a modern reverse proxy and load balancer, to provide scalable and secure routing of HTTP traffic to the platform's components.

- **MinIO Integration**: WKS Platform integrates with MinIO, an object storage server, for efficient and scalable storage of files and attachments associated with cases and processes.

- **Dynamic Form Creation**: By leveraging Form.io, WKS Platform allows users to design and create dynamic forms that adapt to specific case requirements. This empowers organizations to collect structured data efficiently, ensuring data consistency and enabling streamlined processes.

- **Robust Backend**: Built on the Spring Boot framework, WKS Platform provides a scalable and high-performance backend infrastructure. It offers reliable API endpoints, data integration capabilities, and supports extensibility through modular design principles.
