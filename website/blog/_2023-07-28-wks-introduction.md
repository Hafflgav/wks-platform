The Adaptive Case Management Problem
In today's rapidly changing business environment, organizations often grapple with unpredictable scenarios that don't follow a strict process. Whether it's handling unique customer queries, managing varying legal cases, or navigating dynamic project developments, businesses need the agility to adapt. Traditional Business Process Management (BPM) models, which are structured and predictable, may fall short. Enter Adaptive Case Management (ACM): a flexible approach designed for unpredictable work patterns driven primarily by human "knowledge workers."
Consider a healthcare provider tailoring patient treatment plans: while there's a general protocol for certain ailments, individual cases might diverge based on the patient's unique conditions. Such dynamic scenarios necessitate an adaptive approach, and that's where ACM comes in, offering a framework to manage, monitor, and evaluate these unique cases effectively.
CMMN: A Beacon of Hope that Dimmed
Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) emerged as the superhero to address this unpredictability. Introduced following the widespread acceptance of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), CMMN aimed to model unpredictable processes. It promised to capture the dynamics of real-life processes, and the initial industry buzz was palpable. However, while CMMN aimed to bring flexibility, it paradoxically introduced complexities that made it harder to adopt.
Camunda's Experience with CMMN
Camunda, recognizing CMMN's potential, was one of its early champions. From having its member in the CMMN taskforce to swiftly launching a CMMN engine, Camunda was all in. They poured resources into developing the open-source CMMN engine, a modeler, training modules, and admin tools. But as the years rolled by, the enthusiasm around CMMN waned.
Feedback from the Camunda community revealed a glaring issue: while CMMN was intended to simplify unpredictable processes, it often made them more convoluted. Comparing CMMN to BPMN, the latter was simply more intuitive, making it easier for developers and designers to understand and communicate. As Camunda leaned into this feedback, they realized that while CMMN might never die, it didn't truly take off the ground as they'd hoped.
