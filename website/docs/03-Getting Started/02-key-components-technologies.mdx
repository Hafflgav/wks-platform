Key components and technologies
1.	Traefik: A reverse proxy and load balancer for routing and securing HTTP traffic.
2.	Minio: An object storage server providing durable and scalable storage for files and data.
3.	MongoDB: A document-oriented NoSQL database for persistent data storage.
4.	OPA (Open Policy Agent): Used for policy-based authorization and access control.
5.	Camunda: A BPM (Business Process Management) platform for workflow automation and process execution.
6.	Keycloak: An open-source identity and access management solution for authentication and authorization.
7.	case-engine-rest-api: A custom REST API service for case-related functionality.
8.	bpm-engine-c7-external-service: An external service interacting with the BPM engine.
9.	email-to-case: A service converting emails into cases within the platform.
10.	storage-api: An API service for interacting with the Minio storage.
11.	case-portal: A web application built with React, serving as the user interface for the platform.
12.	case-engine-loader: A service responsible for loading case-related data into the platform.
These components utilize various technologies, including:
1.	Docker: A containerization platform used for packaging and deploying the platform components.
2.	Docker Compose: A tool for defining and managing multi-container Docker applications.
3.	HTTP and HTTPS: Protocols used for secure communication between components and clients.
4.	S3-compatible API: The API provided by Minio for storing and retrieving files and data.
5.	NoSQL: MongoDB's document-oriented NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage.
6.	REST API: The architectural style used by the custom API services for communication and data exchange.
7.	React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used in the case-portal web application.
8.	Policy-Based Authorization: The approach used by OPA for defining and enforcing access control policies.
9.	BPMN: The standard notation used by Camunda for modeling and executing business processes.
10.	Identity and Access Management: Keycloak provides features for user authentication, authorization, and management.
11.	JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Keycloak generates JWTs for secure authentication and authorization.
12.	Microservices Architecture: The platform architecture follows a microservices approach, with each component serving specific functionalities and communicating through well-defined APIs.
These key components and technologies form the foundation of the platform architecture, enabling the implementation of a scalable, secure, and extensible system.
