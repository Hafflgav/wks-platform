Installation Guide for the WKS Platform
This installation guide will walk you through the process of setting up the WKS Platform. Please follow the steps below to ensure a successful installation:
Step 1: System Requirements Check
•	Verify that your system meets the minimum system requirements outlined in the system requirements documentation.
Step 2: Java Development Kit (JDK) Installation
•	Install Oracle JDK or OpenJDK 11 or higher on your system.
•	Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the JDK installation directory.
Step 3: MongoDB Installation
•	Install MongoDB 4.2 or higher on your system.
•	Configure MongoDB to run as a service and ensure it starts automatically on system boot.
Step 4: Web Server Installation
•	Install a web server, such as Nginx, Apache, or Traefik, to serve the frontend components and act as a reverse proxy.
Step 5: Identity and Access Management (IAM) Installation
•	Install Keycloak 10.0 or higher to handle authentication and authorization.
•	Configure Keycloak realm, users, and roles as per your requirements.
•	Integrate Keycloak with your chosen web server to enable Single Sign-On (SSO).
Step 6: Workflow and Decision Automation Installation
•	Install Camunda Platform 7.15 or higher, which will be used for process automation and workflow management.
•	Configure Camunda to connect to the MongoDB database.
Step 7: MinIO Installation
•	Install MinIO, an open-source object storage server, to handle document storage for the WKS Platform.
•	Configure MinIO with the desired storage location and access credentials.
Step 8: Open Policy Agent (OPA) Installation
•	Install OPA, an open-source policy engine, to enforce fine-grained access control policies for the WKS Platform.
•	Configure OPA policies based on your organization's security requirements.
Step 9: WKS Platform Installation
•	Download the latest release of the WKS Platform from the official repository or source code repository.
•	Extract the downloaded package to a desired location on your system.
Step 10: Configuration
•	Navigate to the WKS Platform installation directory.
•	Edit the configuration files (e.g., application.properties, camunda.properties) to specify the correct settings, such as database connection details, MinIO integration, and OPA integration.
Step 11: Building and Running the Application
•	Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the WKS Platform installation directory.
•	Build the application using the provided build tools (e.g., Gradle, Maven).
•	Start the application by executing the appropriate startup command (e.g., java -jar wks-platform.jar).
Step 12: Accessing the WKS Platform
•	Open a web browser and enter the URL of your deployed WKS Platform instance.
•	You should be redirected to the Keycloak login page for authentication.
•	After successful login, you can start using the WKS Platform and configure it further based on your organization's requirements.
Congratulations! You have successfully installed the WKS Platform on your system, including MinIO and OPA. Make sure to refer to the official documentation for any additional configuration or customization steps, as well as recommended best practices for deployment, backup, and maintenance.
