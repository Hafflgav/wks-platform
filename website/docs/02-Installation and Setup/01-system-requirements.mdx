System Requirements for the WKS Platform
The WKS Platform is a robust case management and process automation solution that requires specific system requirements to ensure optimal performance and functionality. The following are the system requirements for deploying and running the WKS Platform:
1.	Operating System:
o	Linux (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS) or Windows Server (e.g., Windows Server 2016/2019)
2.	Processor:
o	Minimum: Dual-core 2.0 GHz processor
o	Recommended: Quad-core 2.5 GHz or higher processor
3.	Memory (RAM):
o	Minimum: 4 GB RAM
o	Recommended: 8 GB RAM or higher for better performance
4.	Disk Space:
o	Minimum: 10 GB free disk space
o	Recommended: 20 GB or more, depending on the volume of data and document storage requirements
5.	Java Development Kit (JDK):
o	Oracle JDK or OpenJDK 11 or higher (with JavaFX support)
6.	Database:
o	MongoDB 4.2 or higher (used for storing case data and metadata)
7.	Web Server and Reverse Proxy:

14.	Web Browsers:
o	Latest versions of modern web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge, for accessing the WKS Platform's user interface.
It is important to note that the above system requirements are general guidelines and may vary based on factors like the scale of deployment, the number of concurrent users, and specific customization requirements. It is recommended to refer to the official documentation or deployment guides provided by the WKS Platform for detailed and up-to-date system requirements specific to the version you are installing.
Additionally, regular backups, system monitoring, and maintenance practices should be implemented to ensure the stability, security, and availability of the WKS Platform in production environments.
