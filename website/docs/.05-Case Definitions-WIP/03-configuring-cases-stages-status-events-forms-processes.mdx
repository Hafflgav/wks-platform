Configuring stages, status, events, forms, and processes
This section will guide you through the process of configuring various elements related to stages, status, events, forms, and processes within WKS Platform. Let's explore each topic in detail:
### Configuring Stages
- Stages represent the major phases or milestones within a case.
- Determine the stages relevant to your case and their order of execution.
- Define the names, descriptions, and any associated deadlines for each stage.
- Specify the conditions or criteria for transitioning from one stage to another, if applicable.
### Managing Status
- Status represents the current state or progress of a case.
- Determine the possible statuses that a case can have.
- Define the names, descriptions, and any additional attributes for each status.
- Specify the default status when a case is created and the transitions between different statuses.
### Configuring Events
- Events are triggers or occurrences that affect the case workflow.
- Identify the events that can happen during the case lifecycle.
- Define the names, descriptions, and any associated actions or notifications for each event.
- Specify the conditions or criteria for triggering an event.
### Designing Forms
- Forms capture and display data related to the case.
- Determine the information that needs to be collected at different stages or events.
- Design and configure forms to capture the required data.
- Specify the fields, validation rules, layout, and any associated actions or calculations for each form.
### Defining Processes
- Processes represent the sequence of activities or tasks within a case.
- Identify the processes or workflows that need to be followed.
- Define the names, descriptions, and any associated rules or conditions for each process.
- Specify the sequence and dependencies between processes.
### Mapping Stages, Status, Events, Forms, and Processes
- Map the configured stages, status, events, forms, and processes to the case definition.
- Associate the relevant stages, status, events, forms, and processes with the case definition.
- Define the order and dependencies between stages, status, events, forms, and processes.
### Reviewing and Testing Configuration
- Review the configured elements related to stages, status, events, forms, and processes.
- Validate that the information provided is accurate and meets your requirements.
- Test the configured configuration by creating sample cases and following the defined workflows.
Congratulations! You have successfully configured stages, status, events, forms, and processes within WKS Platform. Remember to regularly review and update your configurations as your case management needs evolve. Refer to the WKS Platform documentation or contact your system administrator for further assistance or advanced configuration options.
